### Digital Scholarship Lab

Raynor Memorial Libraries’ digital scholarship services transform the way faculty and students create and share knowledge by helping them explore new digital tools and methodologies. These services leverage in-house information resources and technologies and library expertise to forge new interdisciplinary connections and accelerate inquiry, discovery, and learning. Among the digital tools we help support are digitization, data visualization, digital mapping, social media, web development, simulation, and data management. In our [Digital Scholarship Lab](https://www.marquette.edu/library/digital-scholarship/), staff are on hand to consult with faculty on incorporating digital tools and methods into both their scholarship and the classroom. The lab space also gives students a dedicated environment for experimenting, collaborating, and creating in digital video, graphics, web publishing, and other media. Our Digital Programs staff are also available to help scholars explore new and emerging publishing options, data management, copyright, and alternative impact metrics.
