## How it works

This blog is a static site built using a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the popular static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Blog posts use snippets of YAML for front matter and Markdown for the body of the post. Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers that allows you to write blog post text using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and then convert your text to HTML for your blog.

You can find the source text for this post at the file called `2021-03-15-welcome-to-the-blog.md` at the `_posts` directory of the [site repository](https://github.com/maxgray20/english-3210). To add a new post to the blog, you can add a new `.md` file at the `_posts` directory that follows the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. You can take a look at the source text for this post to review the necessary front matter.

## Markdown 101

The basics of Markdown's formatting syntax are very easy to learn by the examples of it in action at the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) documententation. You can practice Markdown using the web application [Dingus](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) that allows you to practice writing your own Markdown-formatted text, and then translate it to HTML live.
