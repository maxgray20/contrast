Marquette University Raynor Memorial Libraries leads in the delivery and creation of content and services that focus on the needs of today and the possibilities of tomorrow. We envision the future to anticipate and meet the information needs of a university which aspires to be among the most innovative and accomplished Catholic and Jesuit Universities. We are committed to cultivating a center for engagement that fosters learning, scholarship, and intellectual discovery, all of which are key components of a Catholic, Jesuit education.

Raynor Memorial Librariesâ€™ **digital scholarship services** transform the way faculty and students create and share knowledge by helping them explore new digital tools and methodologies. These services leverage in-house information resources and technologies and library expertise to forge new interdisciplinary connections and accelerate inquiry, discovery, and learning. Among the digital tools we help support are digitization, data visualization, digital mapping, social media, web development, simulation, and data management. In our Digital Scholarship Lab, staff are on hand to consult with faculty on incorporating digital tools and methods into both their scholarship and the classroom. The lab space also gives students a dedicated environment for experimenting, collaborating, and creating in digital video, graphics, web publishing, and other media. Our Digital Programs staff are also available to help scholars explore new and emerging publishing options, data management, copyright, and alternative impact metrics.
