This web site is a static site built using a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

To add new posts, simply add a new file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter.

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
