This web site is a static site built using a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and a popular static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

You can find the source for this post at the file called `2021-03-15-welcome-to-the-site.md` at the `_posts` directory of the [site repository](https://github.com/maxgray20/english-3210). To add a new post, you can add a new `.md` file at the `_posts` directory that follows the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. You can take a look at the source for this post to review the front matter in action.
