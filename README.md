## The blog site

Developed at [GitHub](https://github.com/maxgray20/english-3210) as a mock course blog for the Digital Scholarship Lab at Marquette Libraries. Based on the [Contrast Jekyll theme](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) by [Niklas Buschmann](https://niklasbuschmann.github.io/) licensed under the [The Unlicense](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast/blob/master/UNLICENSE.txt). English 3210 Writing Practices and Processes (WRIT) asks students to engage and reflect on multiple processes of writing; compose in different media and/or genres; address a variety of rhetorical situations and audiences; and examine how social power relates to uses of writing. Students consider: What can writing do? Who am I as a writer? Who am I as a writer among others? What responsibilities do I have when I write?
